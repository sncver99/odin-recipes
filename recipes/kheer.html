    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      kheer, also called payasam, a chilled South Asian dessert made from
      slow-cooked rice, milk, and sugar, much like a rice pudding. It is
      typically flavoured with saffron, cardamom, raisins, and/or various nuts,
      notably pistachios, cashews, and almonds.
    </p>
    <p>
      Kheer is particularly popular in India, and it is commonly served at
      Muslim and Hindu festivals and special occasions.
